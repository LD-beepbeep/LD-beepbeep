### 📝 About Me

Hi, I’m Lars!  
I’m a 14-year-old student of Natural Sciences at the **Royal Atheneum of Zottegem** in Belgium.  

Music has been part of my life as long as I can remember. I play drums in my band **The Fire Of The Band**, but I also play guitar and piano. My favourite genres are **metalcore, hardcore and rock** — loud, fast and full of energy.  

I’m also fascinated by technology. I built my own PC, love tinkering with hardware and software, and from time to time I code in **Java, C++ and Python** to explore new projects and challenges.

Editing is another passion of mine. For video I use **DaVinci Resolve** and for audio **Reaper**. Creating and shaping sound or visuals into a finished product is something I enjoy a lot.

Every week you can catch me **live on [Radio Topscore](https://radiotopscore.be/)** hosting radio shows. Speaking into a mic, connecting with listeners and sharing music is one of my favourite ways to spend a Saturday.

When I’m not studying, making music or coding, you’ll find me cycling, walking, running, gaming or thinking up new projects to create.
